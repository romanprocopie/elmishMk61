This is a sample project implement the arithmetical operations using Reverse Polish Notation, inspired by Soviet calculator Electronika MK-61, which was my first computer back in the days.

The real purpose of this project was to learn Elmish while I was on vacation.

It lacks functions from the original calculator.
It also lacks unit tests and there is a lot of places where they are really needed.

To use it, you need a computer with .NET 5 SDK, just check out the code then "dotnet run".

To play with the code, you will need an editor. This project has been created by IMO the best F# IDE : VS Code with ionide-fsharp

I created it on Ubuntu Budgie, but it should just work on any compatible OS.
