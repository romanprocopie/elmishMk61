This is a sample project implement the arithmetical operations using Reverse Polish Notation, inspired by Soviet calculator Electronika MK-61, which was my first computer back in the days.

The real purpose of this project was to learn Elmish while I was on vacation.

It lacks functions from the original calculator.
It also lacks unit tests and there is a lot of places where they are really needed.
